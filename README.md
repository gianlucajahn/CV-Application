# üìë CV Application

An SPA to create a CV with. You can add, edit and delete input fields to put your data in. All of these changes are adopted by the preview CV in real-time. Once you are happy with the result, you can save and download your CV to your local machine via a simple button click. Also comes with a functionality to autofill all fields and look at what the CV would look like if you filled it out by hand.

## Motivation
My motivation in building this project was to further solidify my understanding of how React handles state. For me at the time, a CV application that needs to handle all user data in state seemed like a reasonable approach to it. Furthermore, I created CVs for all my friends for some years now and felt like some automation to speed up that process wouldn't do no harm.

## Problems and how I solved them

‚ùì **Problem:** Recolor specific buttons on hover

‚ùï **Solution:** While mapping over the current array containing the user's work experience or skills, all buttons get unique ID's through uniqid() and an onMouseEnter + onMouseLeave property. A function from App.js is handed down into these properties and maps over the experience or skill array, changing the "fill:" attribute for the SVG in the button whose ID matches the button that held said onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave property. 



‚ùì **Problem:** Being unable to render the form and preview on mobile reasonably

‚ùï **Solution:** Giving both components conditional class assignments that relied on a piece of state. Said state holds information about which of both components is to be rendered at a time.



‚ùì **Problem:** Requiering the user to be able to download their CV

‚ùï **Solution:** Utilizing both the 'html2canvas' and 'jsPDF' libraries. First, I selected the component that is to be printed into a PDF. Said component is converted into an image (png) by the html2canvas toDataURL method. Afterwards, a new jsPDF() const is created, proportions of the image are being aligned with proportions of the PDF and the .png image is being added and saved to the PDF.
