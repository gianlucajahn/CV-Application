## Motivation
My motivation in building this project was to further solidify my understanding of how React handles state. For me at the time, a CV application that needs to handle all user data in state seemed like a reasonable approach to it. Furthermore, I created CVs for all my friends for some years now and felt like some automation to speed up that process wouldn't do no harm.

## What I learned
- mapping over arrays in state to make sure the selected elements receive changes on user interactions with the site
- using conditional class assignments to either render a desktop or a mobile view for the application, depending on screen width
- using external libraries within my application to enable the user to download and save their CV
